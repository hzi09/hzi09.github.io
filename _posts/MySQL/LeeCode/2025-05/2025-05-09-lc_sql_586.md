[🔗586. Customer Placing the Largest Number of Orders](https://leetcode.com/problems/customer-placing-the-largest-number-of-orders/)

# 📝문제 요약
Table: `Orders`

```
+-----------------+----------+
| Column Name     | Type     |
+-----------------+----------+
| order_number    | int      |
| customer_number | int      |
+-----------------+----------+
order_number is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains information about the order ID and the customer ID.

```

Write a solution to find the `customer_number` for the customer who has placed **the largest number of orders**.

The test cases are generated so that **exactly one customer** will have placed more orders than any other customer.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
Orders table:
+--------------+-----------------+
| order_number | customer_number |
+--------------+-----------------+
| 1            | 1               |
| 2            | 2               |
| 3            | 3               |
| 4            | 3               |
+--------------+-----------------+
Output:
+-----------------+
| customer_number |
+-----------------+
| 3               |
+-----------------+
Explanation:
The customer with number 3 has two orders, which is greater than either customer 1 or 2 because each of them only has one order.
So the result is customer_number 3.

```

**Follow up:** What if more than one customer has the largest number of orders, can you find all the `customer_number` in this case?

# ✏️문제 풀이
## SELECT

```sql
SELECT customer_number
```

- `customer_number`  : 가장 주문을 많이 한 고객의 번호

## FROM

```sql
FROM (
    SELECT customer_number, COUNT(*) AS order_count
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY 1
) AS customer_counts
```

- 서브쿼리(`customer_counts`)
    - `Orders` 테이블에서 `customer_number`별로 묶어서(`GROUP BY`) 고객당 주문 수(`COUNT(*)`)를 셈
    - `GROUP BY 1`은 첫 번째 컬럼, 즉 `customer_number` 기준 그룹화

## ORDER BY

```sql
ORDER BY order_count DESC
```

- `order_count`(주문 수)가 가장 많은 순서로 내림차순 정렬

## LIMIT

```sql
LIMIT 1
```

- 정렬된 결과에서 1번째 데이터만 출력. 즉 , 가장 많은 주문수의 데이터

# 💯제출 코드
```sql
SELECT customer_number
FROM (
    SELECT customer_number, COUNT(*) AS order_count
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY 1
) AS customer_counts
ORDER BY order_count DESC
LIMIT 1
```

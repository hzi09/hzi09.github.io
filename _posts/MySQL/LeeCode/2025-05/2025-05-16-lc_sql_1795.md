[🔗1795. Rearrange Products Table](https://leetcode.com/problems/rearrange-products-table/)

# 📝문제 요약
Table: `Products`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| store1      | int     |
| store2      | int     |
| store3      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row in this table indicates the product's price in 3 different stores: store1, store2, and store3.
If the product is not available in a store, the price will be null in that store's column.

```

Write a solution to rearrange the `Products` table so that each row has `(product_id, store, price)`. If a product is not available in a store, do **not** include a row with that `product_id` and `store` combination in the result table.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
Products table:
+------------+--------+--------+--------+
| product_id | store1 | store2 | store3 |
+------------+--------+--------+--------+
| 0          | 95     | 100    | 105    |
| 1          | 70     | null   | 80     |
+------------+--------+--------+--------+
Output:
+------------+--------+-------+
| product_id | store  | price |
+------------+--------+-------+
| 0          | store1 | 95    |
| 0          | store2 | 100   |
| 0          | store3 | 105   |
| 1          | store1 | 70    |
| 1          | store3 | 80    |
+------------+--------+-------+
Explanation:
Product 0 is available in all three stores with prices 95, 100, and 105 respectively.
Product 1 is available in store1 with price 70 and store3 with price 80. The product is not available in store2.

# ✏️문제 풀이
## 1단계: store1만 먼저 가져오기

```sql
SELECT product_id, 'store1' AS store, store1 AS price
FROM Products
WHERE store1 IS NOT NULL
```

- `'store1' AS store` : 문자열 `'store1'`을 새로운 열(`store`)의 값으로 넣음
- `store1 AS price` : 원래의 가격 값을 `price`로 바꿔줌
- `WHERE store1 IS NOT NULL` : 가격이 없는 데이터는 제외

## 2단계: store2와 store3도 같은 방식으로 작성

```sql
SELECT product_id, 'store2' AS store, store2 AS price
FROM Products
WHERE store2 IS NOT NULL
```

```sql
SELECT product_id, 'store3' AS store, store3 AS price
FROM Products
WHERE store3 IS NOT NULL
```

## 3단계 : `UNION ALL` 사용하여 전체 반환

```sql
SELECT product_id, 'store1' AS store, store1 AS price
FROM Products
WHERE store1 IS NOT NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT product_id, 'store2' AS store, store2 AS price
FROM Products
WHERE store2 IS NOT NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT product_id, 'store3' AS store, store3 AS price
FROM Products
WHERE store3 IS NOT NULL
```

# 💯제출 코드
```sql
SELECT product_id, 'store1' AS store, store1 AS price
FROM Products
WHERE store1 IS NOT NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT product_id, 'store2' AS store, store2 AS price
FROM Products
WHERE store2 IS NOT NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT product_id, 'store3' AS store, store3 AS price
FROM Products
WHERE store3 IS NOT NULL
```
